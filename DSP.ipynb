Our craving to have sizzlers, & thanks to zomato gold, we landed here.\\\\nAmbience is decent.

This was the recommended dish by the staff, hence we were bit disappointed.\\\\nThe only dish which was satisfying was the mix grill which had lamb, chicken, egg & fish.\\\\n\\\\nLastly they do put an extra service charge on top of GST. However they don't mention this when giving the bill. When we checked the bill & asked them, they told it's not mandatory to pay the Service Charge, its up to the customer.

The sizzling brownie is definitely my all time favourite dessert. The staff has been courteous on all occasions and the service has been fast.

The sizzling mexicana comes with a cheese patty is the most right combination that makes you doubt you're own marriage. However, if you don't mind something sweet, the barbecue sizzler with paneer can add sweetness to your life with every bite. I'd suggest you to split this with a pal.\\\\nThe calfornian pizza is one of the best pizza's I've had honestly. It's rich in flavor and brings happiness to your heart. I wouldn't recommend the cheesecake, that is something they have to improve on.\\\\nIt's Affordable and for 3 sizzlers, one pizza, 2 zomato gold the bill came upto just 600.
